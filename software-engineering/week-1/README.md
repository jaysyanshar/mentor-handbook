- Rule:
  - N/A

## Challenging

### My Git Culinary Collection
- Concepts: Put World Culinary Collection into Git. Initialize a local repo, create the primary folder and summary.txt, then commit. For each country, create a new branch, then add the culinary together with the subfolder. Remember to update the summary file in primary folder. Then switch branch to master/main and do a merge.
- Input: Googling result for culinary data
