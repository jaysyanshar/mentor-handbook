# Software Engineering Mentoring Week-2

## Basic Rules
- This is not a demo!
- Mentor will be the facilitator, guiding the mentee to solve the tasks.
- One person will share their screen, can be the mentor and one of the mentee.
- Mentee will take turn in giving the correct commands to be typed by person sharing his/her screen.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand daily activities as a software engineer.
  - Able to formulate algorithm to solve a problem.
  - Able to create pseudocode for simple application.
  - Understand how networking works in the context of web application
    - Able to identify parts of a URI
    - Able to access website by port
  - Able to connect with Github and work with Github repo
    - git clone
    - git checkout
    - git push

## Pre-requisites

- Install code editor (e.g. VS Code)
- Install gitBash for Windows or git for Linux based distro (in WSL for windows)
- Create account in github

## Basic

### Online Food Order

- Concepts: Online Food Order
- Input: Idea
- Output: Algorithm and Pseudocode, can use flowchart
- Rule: The steps must include choosing from the menu and payment.

### Github Link
- Concepts: Using github as an online repo. Using the World Culinary Collection git from the previous week or create a new one is also OK as long as it's similar in structure, for example World Heritage Sites. It is also OK for the mentor to setup his/her github repo and use it together with the mentee. Use git remote and git push to link the local repo with github.
- Input: Existing git project
- Output: Git project is available in Github.
- Rule:
  - preferably use the local git repo from last week.
  - use git remote to link with github repo
  - use git push after commit and check the changes in github.

## Challenging

### Vacation Planning with Github

- Concepts: Vacation planning ( search destination, booking, travelling )
- Input: Ideas, github repo from mentor
- Output: Algorithm using flowchart and pseudocode using text in github
- Rule:
  - Make this a individual collective effort, meaning, give the mentee time, 15 minutes perhaps to create the algorithm and pseudocode, commit and push to individual branch by their names. No PR request yet.
  - Then mentor will show one time how to create a PR
  - Mentee will then create PR based off their branch.
  - Mentor will then do a review for each PR request, pointing out improvement areas for individual mentee, the other mentee can watch as they can learn also.
  - It is possible to have merge conflict, try to resolve together.
  - Can use tools for flowchart such as app.diagrams.net, lucidchart, etc. Export as jpg / png.
